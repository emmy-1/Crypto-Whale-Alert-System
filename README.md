# Abstract

## What Are Crypto Whales
These are entities or individuals that hold a substantial percentage of the total supply of a given cryptocurrency. e.g To put this in perspective, someone who has $1 million worth of an asset with a market capitalization of $100 million is a whale, while someone who holds $1 million worth of an asset with a market capitalization of $30 billion may not be considered a whale
