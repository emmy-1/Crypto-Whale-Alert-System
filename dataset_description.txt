### **Summary**
- The transaction **spends 0.23653744 BTC** from a SegWit address (`bc1q2z0...`).
- The outputs are:
  - **0.00002859 BTC** sent to a **P2SH** address (`36T3zz...`).
  - **0.00003396 BTC** sent to a **SegWit** address (`bc1q8m...`).
  - **0.23646905 BTC** **returned to the sender** (`bc1q2z0...`), acting as change.
- This suggests the transaction **likely involves a small payment, with most BTC returned as change**.
